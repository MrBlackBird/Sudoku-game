# Sudoku-game
 Poorly :) written sudoku game with a terminal interface, made in c++.  
 Should work correctly given that you enter the correct file path to levels.csv file [in the read_level() function]  
 Game contains two full levels (1 - 2), one for testing (3) and you can add your own levels by correctly modifiying the levels.csv file
